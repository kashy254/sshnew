## Protection System

This script includes multiple layers of security that protect your branding:

1. **Binary Protection**:

2. **Script Obfuscation**:
   - All scripts are obfuscated using base64 encoding
   - Scripts become unreadable but remain fully functional
   - Original scripts are securely stored and will self-restore if modified

3. **Visual Elements Protection**:
   - SSH login banners
   - System messages
   - All visual branding elements

4. **Integrity Verification**:
   - Daily checks monitor for tampering attempts
   - Automatic restoration if tampering is detected
   - Detailed security logs for monitoring
